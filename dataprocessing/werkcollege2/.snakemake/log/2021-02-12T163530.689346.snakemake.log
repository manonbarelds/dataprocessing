Error in rule bcftools_call:

    shell:
        samtools mpileup -g -f data/genome.fa sorted_reads/A.bam sorted_reads/B.bam sorted_reads/C.bam | bcftools call -mv - > calls/all.vcf
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bcftools_call since they might be corrupted:
calls/all.vcf
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
