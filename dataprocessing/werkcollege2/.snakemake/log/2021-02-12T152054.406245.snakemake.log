rule bwa_map:

Error in rule bwa_map:
    jobid: 0
    output: mapped_reads/A.bam
    shell:
        bwa mem data/genome.fa data/samples/A.fastq | samtools view -Sb - > mapped_reads/A.bam
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job bwa_map since they might be corrupted:
mapped_reads/A.bam
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
